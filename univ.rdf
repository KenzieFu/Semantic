In the 2021 QS World Universities Ranking, UGM is ranked 1st in Indonesia and 254th in the world. When the university was established in the 1940s under Dutch rule, it was the first medicine faculty freely open to native Indonesians, at a time when native education was often restricted. Comprising 18 faculties and 27 research centers, UGM offers 68 undergraduate, 23 diploma, 104 master and specialist, 43 doctorate and 4 clusters of post doctoral study programs. The university has enrolled approximately 55,000 students, 1,187 foreign students, and has 2,500 faculty members. UGM maintains a campus of 360 acres (150 ha), with facilities that include a stadium and a fitness center. The university is named after Gajah Mada, a 14th-century leader of the Majapahit Empire of Java, considered by some historians to be the nation's first unifier; the university's name still reflects the old Dutch-era spelling. The 7th President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, earned his degree in forestry in 1985.

        ITB was considered the top choice among Indonesia's high school students in 2006 and has been credited as one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia, together with Gadjah Mada University and University of Indonesia. Sukarno, the first president of the Republic of Indonesia, earned his engineering degree in civil engineering from ITB. Furthermore, B. J. Habibie, the third president of Indonesia, also spent a year in the mechanical engineering department of ITB and is officially recognized as a graduate. The university cultivates professional and social activities by supporting its students' unions, the student government councils that exist in every department. Each students' union has its own distinctly designed jacket that, among other traditions, serves as part of its member identity. There are also a number of student activity units/clubs supporting ITB student interests in rounding out their educational experience. It is not uncommon that the students and alumni are identified by the clubs to which they belong (or used to belong) at ITB, in addition to their class year and major. As of 2020, ITB had thirteen undergraduate study programs been internationally accredited from an independent U.S.-based accrediting institution, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. The thirteen study programs are Electrical Engineering, Informatics, Chemical Engineering, Engineering Physics, Industrial Engineering, Engineering Management, Ocean Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Mining Engineering, Electrical Power Engineering, and Telecommunication Engineering. ITB's march "Mars ITB" and hymn "Hymne ITB" were arranged by a former professor, Prof. Dr. Sudjoko Danoesoebrata.
